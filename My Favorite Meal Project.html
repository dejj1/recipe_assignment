    <h1>My Favorite Meal</h1>

    <p>
      The name of my favorite meal is <strong>Nigerian Jollof Rice.</strong
      ><br />
    </p>
    <br />

    <h2>ORIGIN OF THE NIGERIAN JOLLOF RICE</h2>
    <p>
      Jollof is believed to have originated in the Senegambia region of West
      Africa among the Wolof people, where it is known as <i>benachin</i>. The
      mouth-watering meal has travelled throughout the sub-region because of the
      frequent cultural exchange that goes on there. As such, it has evolved
      into several regional varieties, laced with the heritage of the place
      where it is prepared. Nevertheless, it maintains its magic and is relished
      all over Africa.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;For those who aren’t familiar with Jollof rice and are
      wondering how a rice dish can pack so much punch, the secret is in how it
      soaks up so much flavour. You would not imagine that boiling plain rice in
      the same pot as peppers, tomatoes, spices and meats would create such
      soft, yet crisp tomato-stained grains, with so much sweetness locked
      inside them.

    <h2>DIRECTIONS FOR PREPARATION</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a blender, combine tomatoes, red poblano (or bell) peppers, chopped
        onions, with 2 cups of stock, blend till smooth, about a minute or two.
        You should have roughly 6 cups of blended mix. Pour into a large pot/
        pan and bring to the boil then turn down and let simmer, partly covered
        for 10 - 12 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a large pan, heat oil and add the sliced onions. Season with a pinch
        of salt, stir-fry for 2 to 3 minutes, then add the bay leaves, curry
        powder and dried thyme and a pinch of black pepper for 3 - 4 minutes on
        medium heat. Then add the tomato paste - stir for another 2 minutes. Add
        the reduced tomato-pepper-Scotch bonnet mixture, stir, and set on medium
        heat for 10 to 12 minutes till reduced by half, with the lid partly on.
        This is the stew that will define the pot.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add 4 cups of the stock to the cooked tomato sauce and bring it to boil
        for 1 - 2 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the rinsed rice and butter, stir, cover with a double piece of
        foil/baking or parchment paper and put a lid on the pan—this will seal
        in the steam and lock in the flavor. Turn down the heat and cook on the
        lowest possible heat for 30 minutes, stirring half way through.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir rice—taste and adjust as required. If rice isn't soft enough/ needs
        additional cooking, add 1/4 to 1/2 cup of stock or water, stir through
        and continue to steam, on low till cooked through.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you like, add sliced onions, fresh tomatoes and the 2nd teaspoon of
        butter and stir through. Let rest, covered for 5 to 6 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        To make Party Rice, you'll need one more step. Now Party Rice is
        essentially Smoky Jollof Rice, traditionally cooked over an open fire.
        However, you can achieve the same results on the stove top. Here's how:
        Once the rice is cooked, turn up the heat with the lid on and leave to
        "burn" for 3 to 5 minutes. You'll hear the rice crackle and snap and it
        will smell toasted. Turn off the heat and leave with the lid on to
        "rest" till ready to serve. The longer the lid stays on, the smokier.
        Let the party begin!
      </li>
    </ol>
